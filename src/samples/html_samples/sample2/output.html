	Welcome to my Blog!
</h3>
<p>
	This is a sample html document.
	<br>
	</br>
	Tags and texts are separated in this sample,
	which means a tag and a text can't be mixed in a line.
	<br>
	</br>
	You can write a long sentence without line concatenation.
	<br>
	</br>
	A normal line is interpreted as a text line automatically,
	but tags must be prefixed with ">\", which is a bit noisy.
	<br>
	</br>
	An empty line translates to a &lt;BR&gt; tag.
	<br>
	</br>
	These settings are written in a first line. See "(repository_root)/lang_spec.txt" about it.
